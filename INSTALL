Mirage has been tested on:
- Debian Squeeze x86_64 and x86_32
- MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard x86_64

To build it, you must first:
1) Bootstrap the compiler toolchain
2) Build the tools
3) Build the core libraries

Bootstrap
---------

This builds and installs the compiler toolchain, by default into ~/mir-inst. You can alter this by setting the PREFIX variable to the make target:

$ make PREFIX=<location> bootstrap

At this point, add the <location>/bin to head of your PATH variable so that the remaining steps can find the toolchain.

Tools
-----

This installs the build tools and syntax extensions into the install PREFIX.

$ make PREFIX=<location> tools

The tools include the 'mir' build utility, a custom version of ocamldsort to help with dependency management, and the MPL protocol specification meta-compiler.

Libraries
---------

$ make

This will build the OCaml libraries and the Xen custom runtime, if appropriate.

Build an application
--------------------

Build a Xen kernel in-tree:
$ mir dx tests/ping
output will be in tests/ping/mirage-os.gz

Build a UNIX binary in-tree:
$ mir du tests/ping
output will be in tests/ping/mirage-unix

Configure your network
======================

On Debian:

* if you have one physical interface called eth0 :

  $ sudo apt-get install bridge-utils
  $ sudo brctl addbr br0
  $ sudo brctl addif br0 eth0

From this point, you loose connectivity.

* Edit your /etc/network/interfaces file to look like :

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
  # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
  
  # The loopback network interface
  auto lo br0
  iface lo inet loopback

  # Set up interfaces manually, avoiding conflicts with, e.g., network manager
  iface eth0 inet manual

  iface eth1 inet manual

  # Bridge setup
  iface br0 inet dhcp
  		bridge_ports eth0 eth1
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* bring up the new bridge to get your connectivity back:

  $ sudo ifup br0

Test the ping application
=========================

* Build ping :

  $ mir du tests/ping

* Run the test

  $ sudo ./tests/ping/mirage-unix & sudo brctl addif br0 tap0
