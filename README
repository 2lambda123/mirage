Mirage is a programming platform for building high-performance, portable
networked applications.  It can target standard UNIX platforms, and also
compile applications into a standalone operating system that runs under
the Xen hypervisor.

It is based around the Objective Caml language, with a replacement
standard library and syntax extensions.
