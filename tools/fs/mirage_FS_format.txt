Generate a simple flat file metadata format to enable fast IO 
access to static data.

1] No directory structure (can be added later)
2] Each file must start on a 4k boundary
3] Each file must have a metadata entry held at the 
start of the disk aligned to a sector boundary

Format:
Magic String - 4 bytes (set to 0xDEADBEED)
64 bit offset - 8 bytes
64 bit length - 8 bytes
Filename - variable length (up to 488), null terminated
