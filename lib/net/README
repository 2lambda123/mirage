The Net module covers external communication.

The direct/ module is an OCaml implementation of the network stack,
from Ethernet up.  It has individual modules for applications to mess
around at the protocol level, all the way up to a stream-based Flow
module which abstracts away the protocol details.

The socket/ module is a mapping of the high-level stream/message modules
to UNIX sockets.

Applications that use the common modules will thus interoperate.
