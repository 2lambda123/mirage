## Mirage

Mirage is a programming framework for constructing secure, high-performance
network applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.
Code can be developed on a normal OS such as Linux or MacOS X, and then
compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised unikernel that runs under the Xen
hypervisor. Since Xen powers most public cloud computing infrastructure such
as Amazon EC2, this lets your servers run more cheaply, securely and finer
control than with a full software stack.

The most up-to-date documentation can be found at the
[homepage](http://www.mirage.io).  The site is self-hosted and a
useful [example](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www). Simpler
[skeleton applications](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton) are
also available online.

### This repository

This repository includes:

* a command-line tool to create and deploy applications with Mirage.
* in `types/`, a library of type signatures that compliant applications use.

There are several diverse backends in Mirage that require rather specialised
build steps (from Javascript to Xen unikernels), and this complexity is
wrapped up in the tool.

To work with Mirage, you'll need the following prerequisites installed:

* a working [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) compiler (4.01.0 or higher).
* the [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org) source package manager (1.2.0 or
  higher).
* an x86\_64 or armel Linux host to compile Xen kernels, or FreeBSD,
  OpenBSD or MacOS X for the userlevel version.

There are three stages to using `mirage`:

* a *configuration* phase where OPAM package dependencies are
  satisfied.
* a *build* phase where the compiler and any support scripts are run.
* a *run* phase where `mirage` spawns and tracks the progress of the
  deployment (e.g. as a UNIX process or a Xen kernel).

### Configuration files

`mirage` currently uses a configuration file to build a Mirage unikernel.
While we're documenting it all, please see the `lib_test` directory in
this repository for the regression examples.  The latest instructions are
also to be found at <http://openmirage.org/docs>

### Configuring Mirage Applications

Provided that one and only one file of name `<foo>.conf` (where
`<foo>` can be any string) is present in the current working
directory, the command:

```
mirage configure
```

will configure your project. It will generate a `Makefile` and
`main.ml` with the appropriate boilerplate for your chosen
platform.

To configure for the Unix-direct target (using tap interfaces), do:

```
mirage configure --unix
```

To build for the Xen target, do:

```
mirage configure --xen
```

### Building Mirage Applications

The command:

```
make
```

### Running Mirage Applications

Every mirage backend will have a different way to be deployed. On
unix, the unikernel will run as a Unix process, using a virtual
interface (tap) if needed:

```
./mir-<project-name>
```

On Xen, the unikernel will run as a virtual machine. For instance,
using the `xl` command-line tool:

```
xl create <project-name>.xl
```

Configuration files for `xe` and `libvirt` are also generated by the
tool (see the files `<project-name>_libvirt.xml` and
`<project-name>.xe` in the build directory)

### Compiling to Xen and deploying to the cloud

In order to deploy a Mirage unikernel to Amazon EC2, you need to
install the AWS tools on your machine, build a unikernel with the
`--xen` option and then use the `ec2.sh` script (in directory
`script`) in order to register your kernel with AWS. Then you can start
your kernel with the web interface to AWS or any other means AWS
provides to start EC2 instances.
