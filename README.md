Mirage is a programming platform for building high-performance, portable
networked applications.  It can target standard UNIX platforms, and also
compile applications into a standalone operating system that runs under
the Xen hypervisor.

It is based around the Objective Caml language, with a replacement
standard library and syntax extensions. You can read an overview of the
project in the USENIX HotCloud paper available at:

An early self-hosting website (that may be down fairly often!) is
available at http://www.openmirage.org/

This repository is still in a pre-alpha state and not suitable for use. If
